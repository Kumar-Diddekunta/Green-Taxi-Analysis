I implemented three dashboards for the NYC Green Taxi Analysis:

Dashboard 1: Ride Analysis
The Ride Analysis dashboard examines trip patterns and demand drivers, revealing that weekday mornings and evenings exhibit the highest ridership, aligning with commuting peaks. Manhattan pickup locations dominate during regular hours, while outer boroughs like Queens show steadier non-holiday seasonal fluctuations.

Dashboard 2: Fare Analysis
The Fare Analysis dashboard allows for comparison of trip costs by associated factors, showing that fares per mile are highest in Staten Island and the Bronx. Fares in other boroughs fluctuate over time with surcharges and passenger loads.

Dashboard 3: Speed Analysis
The Speed Analysis dashboard provides a detailed examination of green taxi speeds in New York City. It features metrics such as average speed per ride, ride duration intervals, and speed variations across different boroughs and hours.
